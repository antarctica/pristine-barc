# Tests ...

# Flush handlers
#
# This ensures any pending handlers are executed before any tests are performed. This is particularly important where
# a service needs to be restarted before new configuration options are used for example.

- meta: flush_handlers

# Atomic checks
#
# These checks mirror individual tasks to ensure they execute correctly
# E.g. creating a user, installing the right package or generating a valid configuration file

- include: atomic/register-role.yml

# BARC Manifest checks
#
# These checks ensure Ansible local facts were set correctly by this role

- action: setup

- name: assert role was applied via BARC manifest
  assert:
    that:
      - "ansible_local.barc_Â£ROLE-NAME-VARIABLE-SAFE.general.role_applied == 'true'"

# Functionality checks
#
# These checks ensure overall processes can be completed to give a valid result
# E.g. checking a web-server serves a web-page ensures the relevant packages and configuration files work together

# There are no functionality checks for this role
